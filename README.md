A wombat, of the family Vombatidae, known for its burrowing prowess, efficiently uncovers hidden structures beneath the surface. 

**Wide Object ML Boosted Algorithm Trigger** (WOMBAT) is designed to identify boosted jets using low-level calorimeter trigger primitive data from the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment. This process employs a convolutional neural network with an embedded deterministic autoencoder architecture to discern boosted jet substructures in proton-proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). WOMBAT integrates Quantization Aware Training to achieve sub-0.1 microsecond inference latency on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs).

## About Event Displays


This repository contains organized event displays showcasing HCAL and ECAL trigger primitives (TPGs), along with a response from the WOMBAT trigger compared to an offline AK8 jet clustering and tagging algorithm.
